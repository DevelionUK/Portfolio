# Portfolio

This is the personal profile for Richard Adams, a quality and testing specialist based in the UK.

## Automation

### Experience

Over the years I have worked with a bunch of different frameworks. My preference has been C# based:
- Unit testing with Microsoft Test, nUnit and xUnit
- Component testing with Microsoft Test & nUnit
- E2E tests with xUnit & bespoke driver
- E2E tests with bespoke framework (made it myself)

I have also had limited professional experience with typescript frameworks:
- Playwright
- Protractor
- Jest

I've also used CppUnit.

### Projects

As obviously I can't share any of the professional work I've done, instead I'm adding a few small projects to demonstrate usage of some frameworks / techniques.

#### Adventures in Text

[Adventures in Text Automation](AdventuresInTextAutomation)

Adventures in Text is a game that I originally released on Xbox 360 in 2016 and I've been remaking it with a mix of different frameworks and front ends in order to allow me to dabble with some different technologies.

Whilst the project itself has unit tests (at least for the core gameplay library), I have decided to include the E2E tests within this repository. There's some C# Playwright tests so far plus a couple of K6 scripts.

#### Security Test Activities

[Security Test Activities](SecurityTestActivities)

I've created a suite of activities for people to practice & learn basic security testing with. Within this solution I will be using different frameworks to test that the pages are working.

So far I've used Selenium with C#, including layered acceptance tests via Reqnroll.

#### TDD Workshop

(coming soon)
