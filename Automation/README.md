# Portfolio

This is the personal profile for Richard Adams, a quality and testing specialist based in the UK.

## Automation

### Experience

Over the years I have worked with a bunch of different frameworks. My preference has been C# based:
- Unit testing with Microsoft Test, nUnit and xUnit
- Component testing with Microsoft Test & nUnit
- E2E tests with xUnit & bespoke driver
- E2E tests with bespoke framework (made it myself)

I have also had limited professional experience with typescript frameworks:
- Playwright
- Protractor
- Jest

I've also used CppUnit but hated that!

### Projects

As obviously I can't share any of the professional work I've done, instead I'm adding a few small projects to demonstrate usage of some frameworks / techniques.

- [Selenium and C#](Selenium-C#)
- TDD Workshop (coming soon)
