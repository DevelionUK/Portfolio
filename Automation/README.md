# Portfolio

This is the personal profile for Richard Adams, a quality and testing specialist based in the UK.

## Automation

### Experience

Over the years I have worked with a bunch of different frameworks. My preference has been C# based:
- Unit testing with Microsoft Test, nUnit and xUnit
- Component testing with Microsoft Test & nUnit
- E2E tests with xUnit & bespoke driver
- E2E tests with bespoke framework (made it myself)

I have also had limited professional experience with typescript frameworks:
- Playwright
- Protractor
- Jest

I've also used CppUnit.

### Projects

As obviously I can't share any of the professional work I've done, instead I'm adding a few small projects to demonstrate usage of some frameworks / techniques.

#### Security Test Activities

[SecurityTestActivities](Security Test Activities)

I've created a suite of activities for people to practice & learn basic security testing with. Within this solutuion I will be using different frameworks to test that the pages are working.

So far I've used Selenium with C#.

#### Cypress

To experiment with Cypress I have created two projects so far. One to test my [Threat Agents Remote](https://threatagentsgame.com/remote/) application and another for API testing with a sample API application that I have.

#### TDD Workshop

(coming soon)
