## Security Test Activities

Since 2022 I have been working on activities that people can go through to help learn security testing. Some of these are [publicly available activities](https://r-adams.co.uk/securitytestactivity/) but some are from workshops or created for demos in videos etc.

The tests here are testing my activities, rather than being dedicated security tests. After all - the tests would fail given I deliberately created vulnerabilities!

## C# And Selenium

As I've not had hands on experience with Selenium in the past, I thought it would be good to explore it. Rather than handling a new framework and less familiar language at the same time, I picked C#. I've also been using Visual Studio Code as a lighterweight option to my usual go to of Visual Studio (plus I no longer have a Pro license!) so there may be some clunkiness in my project configuration.

So far I have created a simple test class for one of my security test activities, which tests that the hinted solution can be solved, the hint isn't shown by default and error handling for the "Title ID" is in place.
