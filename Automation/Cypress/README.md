## Cypress

I haven't used Cypress in a professional manner. I have used it for fun in my spare time before, but unfortunately it was just kept on my laptop which since failed so I'm starting from scratch.

### Threat Agents Remote

This is an online version of my threat modelling card game.

It has images that you can click, which will display a different image (equivalent of playing a card). It is rather ugly and simple but still felt like a nice way to make my first steps into Cypress automation.
