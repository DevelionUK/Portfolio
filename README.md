# Portfolio

This is the personal profile for Richard Adams, a quality and testing specialist based in the UK.

## Ethos

I believe in continuous quality and building quality into our products. This is more than having a bunch of automated tests. It is refinement and planning. It is learning and growing. It is understanding our users and building what they need. Finally I am a believer in being effective with our testing efforts. Automate our ACs and behaviours then explore to discover more about our solution.

## Skills

I would describe my key skills:

- Excellent adhoc & exploratory testing: I find bugs.
- Leader on quality with coaching and teaching experience plus delivered many initiatives on quality.
- User focused

## Projects & creations

### Threat Agents

In 2021 I started learning about threat modelling. After seeing how beneficial and useful it can be I tried getting interest in my office but it was luke warm at best. Inspired by watching a talk on gamifying meetings, I put together a basic card game. After success trying it with my teams, it is [now available to buy](https://threatagentsgame.com/).

### Video Games

As a hobby developer I have made a number of video games. Unfortunately none are still available on mobile devices but some PC games are still available. Check them out at [oxygen-addict.co.uk](https://oxygen-addict.co.uk)!

### Security Test Activities

A series of 9 small challenges that will help guide you through making basic attacks involving techniques like SQL injection and cross site scripting. This is followed by a capture the flag challenge.
