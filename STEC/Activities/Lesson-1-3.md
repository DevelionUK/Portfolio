# Software Testing Essentials Certificate

## Module 1 Lesson 3 - The many ways people talk about testing

## Activity: Describe software testing to anybody

This activity had me reflecting upon definitions of software testing. Correctness and assessing the product are common themes with many others also thinking about uncovering information. Subsequently I wanted my definition to include this discovery / exploratory aspect whilst highlighting the goals of knowing whether the software sovles the customer's need (meets requirements) and is of sufficient quality (shippable state).

> Software testing is the discovering of information about a software solution to provide an evaluation of the quality and understanding of behaviours to stakeholders. It allows us to verify whether the requirements have been met and whether it is in a shippable state.

Note that from my own experience I do believe that testing can go further, testing the requirements themselves, our processes and uncovering risks. However I am happy with the above as a definition for an entry level explanation.
