## Module 6 Lesson 4: How to contribute to risk analysis sessions

### Test Bytes notes

Fun quotes: 

- "What is important about quality to our application?" (Beren Van Daele)
- "We haven't thought thoroughly enough about quality if we haven't thought about what could go wrong with it" (Beren Van Daele)

Interesting thoughts:

- Need to be the driving force. Reflecting upon previous projects, risk analysis really isn't something that the developers were engaged with. The one exception being when a senior engineer did RAID analysis for a project known as ASH.
- Third parties being a massive alarm bell. From my personal experience, this includes teams or groups within the same organisation, especially when silos are in place.
- Listening for gaps. This reminds me of Larvae Hunting!
- Manish covered what I think was described as [Scenario analysis in Lesson 3](Lesson-6-3.md) and I've definitely done a lot of that!
- Most of the ideas and experiences from the speakers were a collaborative / conversational focus rather than one person going away and doing the risk analysis.

### Activity: Reflection

Reflecting upon what was discussed and my own experiences, I feel like I've definitely had gaps in my risk analysis. However at the same time, I've probably (when enabled) been asking the right questions but perhaps not framed as risks. For example instead of thinking about the risk of network loss, I'd straight add it as a test case. Some of this was instinctive as I've seen patterns, know about past experiences etc and don't need to "think" about those risks. They are always there.

Two areas where I think that I could have done better were championing and a quality focus. To elaborate, I did some risk analysis with teams (and independently) but it was shallow. Occassionally I did get us doing more deeper risk analysis but the group were only really willing to accept it as a novelty / rarity. "Something a bit different". I should have been stronger in pushing us to do more risk analysis.

For the second part, I don't have access to any of the risks I had in the past but I think I did get a little too project focused rather than quality focused with them. As alluded to earlier, I think that I was basically skipping the "risk" stage and going straight to "what could impact quality?" ... "I'll test for that", rather than defining and prioritising the risk.

What is interesting with this is that I remember being challenged on the merits of thinking about the tests in advance and I would highlight that if we think about what goes wrong in advance, we can hopefully implement without introducing any defects/issues. The whole "shift left". Perhaps instead of test case identification, saying scenario analysis would have been better!
