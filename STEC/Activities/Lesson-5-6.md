## Module 5 Lesson 2: The relationship between testing and quality

### Activity (Reflection) 
 
This is something that I reflected upon within my ["What is quality?"](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/03/what-is-quality/) blog post but with food. I compared a microwave meal, takeaway/fast food and fine dining and how they have differing expectations and measures of quality. I've also had discussions with colleages on who had the highest quality sandwich, pointing out that the cheap £1 ham sandwich adhered closer to the requirements of what makes a sandwich than my decent £3 sarnie with fillings haphazardly distributed and another colleague's £5 sarnie with delicious filling oozing out.

As a second item to consider, I have went with the glass that I am currently drinking from. It is a tumbler from [herdy](https://www.herdy.co.uk/kitchen-home/drinking-glasses/herdy-line-tumbler), which I got a couple of weeks ago and cost me £6.95. It wasn't chosen because I believed it would be a higher quality glass than others in my house. I don't expect it to be more durable or resistent. In fact compared to cheaper plain glasses, I know that it's quality is likely to decline over time with washes. From a specification point of view, it is no more or less quality than any other product but to me, it has an extra value. The herdy brand is based upon herdwick sheep from my native land, Cumbria. Having a herdy glass is a representation of home, family and self-identity. Plus the sheep is cute.

A more expensive glass from a fancy store wouldn't offer this same charm. A cheaper glass fills the need (not that I needed more glasses) but without sparking any joy.

And that in itself is an interesting quality aspect. The ability to spark joy. It matters a lot when we think about our household belongings, clothes and alike. However in software we can get bogged down in that correctness and adherence to requirements (functional & non-functional).
