## Module 6 Lesson 8: Sharing risks: How to communicate risk information

### Activity: A security vulnerability

Interesting activity as I've been through this myself, although not following the actions described in the actitivity.

The stakeholders will vary depending on the severity and in my case it was the developer, PO and engineering manager. I gave a heads up to the developer first before escalating. The bug was of course critical.

The risk was around being able to increase your permissions and make changes to the system that you shouldn't be able to do.

Rather than drafting an email I would actually prefer to use Slack (or equivalent). Emails can be pretty passive and I know some people get a lot so instead I would share a message stating what I've found, link to the defect and then proceed to schedule a call. I would want to be able to describe and demonstrate the issue.

When we agreed to escalate the issue further, I would compose an email, get it reviewed by my manager and/or engineering manager and then send that to our lead on cyber security. I could then talk it through with them and give them the information needed.
