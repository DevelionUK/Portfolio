# Software Testing Essentials Certificate

## Module 4 Lesson 6: Testing personas and their uses

### Previous Work

There was no activity here but I wanted to call out some previous work with Personas.

Whilst working with Motorola Solutions the "customer" was not necessarily the end user as we worked with Partners & sold to System Integrators. When developing features around how people can view their entire site it was important that we understood that these were not just different roles to those working day to day with our solution but potentially another organisation. On top of this, the people who performed setup of hardware, software and used the client were possibly all different roles.

To help with this, as well as running a Brown Bag, I created a variety of Personas with little bios, their role & company plus what they appreciate and hate. There was then more details on the different companies and a map of their relationships. We then used some of these those within our test environment. They cropped up in refinement on a couple of occassions. We used them in sprint demos (my personas had cards that people could include). We also used them in our user journey testing.

They proved a really good way to help the teams understand the different users & stakeholders of our solution. It helped people think about the pain points and things that would be frustrated by to help with the UX.
