## Module: Lesson 4: The role of testing across different team structures

### Reflections

This lesson outlined five different structures that testers may encounter. I have worked in five of these four approaches and would definitely be open to the first should the developers be assuming sufficient responsibility.

Being part of a cross-functional team can have the most impact in my view as it gets that testing mindset involved earlier. As Aj highlights, it can get the tester involved in defining requirements and contributing to TDD or BDD. 

I've seen TaaS as an advertised service but this feels less than ideal as there would inevitably be a dettachment between test and developers (more so than dedicated test teams). That said, I have worked with dedicated localization testers, which makes perfect sense and is a targetted testing type.

Community and crowd testing for alpha / beta releases makes sense as well. I've experienced this with games. It really does depend on the application. I wouldn't advocate on relying on this method as the quality of the testing is likely to be reduced.
