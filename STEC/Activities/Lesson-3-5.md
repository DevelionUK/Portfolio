# Software Testing Essentials Certificate

## Module 3 Lesson 5: Building your tester skills plan

### Activity: Your tester skills plan

#### Section 1: Self-assessment of key skills



##### Strengths

| Strength | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 1: Collaboration | I am very good at organising workshops and activities. As a facilitator I like to create collaboration. I have also experience of pairing with people, although there is a lot of area to grow here as I feel socially awkward with pairing. |
| 2: Inquisitiveness | I will ask questions regularly. Within refinement I want to understand the feature more, the need and the behaviours. My inquistivity helps me find defects as I have that curiosity to try different things. |
| 3: Critical thinking | I like analysing issues and I believe that I am also good at trying to think of different perspectives. From thinking about user's perspectives to understanding the reasons people would have for making decisions. |

##### Weaknesses

| Weakness | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 1: Attention to detail | Whilst I can have the attention to detail for spotting defects, my reading and writing can be sloppy. I have a tendancy to get distracted. |
| 2: Communication | Similar to above but verbally I can get a little caught up and muddled. This has worsened since a certain event. |
| 3: Time Management | My time management issues tend to be on fluid / active days. I can fail to give myself the time needed to complete a task. |

#### Section 2: Identify opportunities and threats

| Skill to develop | Opportunity | Threat |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1: Collaboration | When I start my next role, I can aim to collaborate and pair more than I normally would. Another opportunity is to find an opportunity to collaborate with someone within Ministry of Testing, for example completing an exercise together or even writing an article together. Epic Test Quest is another avenue. | My current employment situation makes this difficult to work on as I have no one readily available to collaborate with. |
| 2: Attention to detail | I am starting a research project so it is important that I have attention to detail in my recording of answers and analysis. | So distractable. |

#### Section 3: Set SMART Goals

##### Strength goal

I will improve my collaboration by pairing up with someone from Ministry of Testing on creating a form of content. As soon as I have completed STEC, I will make this next on my agenda. A live testing session, creating a tool or writing an article as possibilities. I aim to have this scheduled by the end of the year.

A further goal will be pairing with colleagues to understand how they test when I start my next role. After each day that I do this I will take personal notes then after the 10th day I do this, I will reflect upon my growth here.

##### Weaknesses goal

To address my attention to detail challenges I will experiment with a reduced distraction environment to provide analysis and notes on my research project. To assess my success, rather than re-reading (which is prone to attention to detail mistakes), I will use a text to speech tool to repeat back my findings (possibly headphones and blindfold). This will be done by the 20th November.
