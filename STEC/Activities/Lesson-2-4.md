# Software Testing Essentials Certificate

## Module 2 Lesson 3: The key skills and traits of a software tester

### Activity: Map key skills to essential testing tasks 

#### Scenario 1: Investigating a Bug Report

> You receive a bug report from a customer describing an issue with a login feature. The report lacks detailed steps to reproduce the problem. You need to figure out the exact steps to recreate the bug and provide a clear report to the development team.

** Skills / Traits: ** Problem-Solving, Attention to Detail, Inquisitiveness, Time Management and Organisation, Spotting Patterns, Analytical skills

** Explanation: ** For this scenario I've focused in on the need to analyse the issue. It will need you to see patterns in logs or behaviours, focus on details and also have an inquisitive aspect to investigate the issue. Once done, you'll need that attention to detail (as well as communication) to provide the updated bug report. I also called out time management and organisation as it can be easy to sink lots of time into an investigation so being aware of the time spent is important. Do you need to stop and rethink or get help?

#### Scenario 2: Collaborating on a New Feature

> Your team is building a new feature, and you’re attending a meeting with developers and the product manager. It’s your job to understand the requirements, ask relevant questions, and think about potential risks associated with the new feature.

** Skills / Traits: ** Critical Thinking, Inquisitiveness, Attention to Detail, Communication, Collaboration

** Explanation: ** Communication and collaboration are essential here. Critical thinking and Inquisitiveness will help us identify those unexpected edge cases, potential risks and flaws within the requirements. Understanding the details can also be very important as any misunderstandings in requirements can have significant negative impacts.

#### Scenario 3: Conducting Exploratory Testing

> You’ve been asked to perform exploratory testing on a new release. The goal is to find issues that may not be covered by pre-existing test cases, so you need to come up with different ways to test the feature.

** Skills / Traits: ** Inquisitiveness, Attention to Detail, Critical Thinking, Problem-Solving, Time Management and Organisation, Spotting Patterns

** Explanation: ** To effectively exploratory test we need the inquisitivenesss and critical thinking required to think of interesting ideas and scenarios as well as an attention to detail, looking at the behaviours ongoing and importantly writing them down! Finally time management is important to avoid spending an entire day on a low priority area or disappearing down a rabbit hole when there are other areas of risk still to be considered.

#### Scenario 4: Prioritising Bugs for a Release

> There are multiple bugs in the system, but not all of them can be fixed before the next release. You need to analyse the impact and severity of each bug and collaborate with the team to decide which ones to address.

** Skills / Traits: ** Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, Analytical skills

** Explanation: ** The ability to think about the issue, collaborate and ask meaningful questions will help the group determine the priorities as well as leveraging your own analytical mind.
