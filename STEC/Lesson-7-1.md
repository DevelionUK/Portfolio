## Module 7 Lesson 1: What is systems thinking?

### Activity: What does system thinking mean to you?

Systems thinking is where we consider the different components and how they interact together. We aren't fixated on just the component that has changed, nor are we ignoring the nuances and behaviours of individual components to focus on the whole system. When something changes in one service, we look at all the impacted services and consider them. We view the system as a whole but think about everything involved within it.

I suspect the course will touch upon this but for me it comes into how I liked doing test strategy with my teams. Modelling the whole system and considering the risks in the different components and how they will work together.
