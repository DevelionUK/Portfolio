## Module 13 Lesson 2: So many bugs, so little time: How to prioritise bug fixes

### Activity: How would you prioritise this bug?

First of all, an issue like this definitely needs to be logged. I've previously written a [blog post on the value of bug reports](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2021/12/03/value-of-a-bug-report/). The only circumstances that I won't report it is if the applicable story is still open and we can track it through that, or if it is agreed that it is not a bug. Although I do recall once agreeing to disagree so I entered the bug anyway and the dev manager just closed it. When a poorly written escalation came through, we had a record of the bug, steps and logs.

Anyway, I digress.

A valuable question is is whether this is a regression. If the behaviour isn't new then I would fully expect it to be lower on the backlog than the high priority feature described in the scenario. If it is a regression then I'd be putting more emphasis on a fix. How quick and easy is it to perform the workaround of re-adding the return date? I'd assume not very given it sounds like we're viewing the same form.

Right now I'd be making a case to fix it because it is annoying, but it is by no means a critical issue. The next question is the complexity of the fix. If this is a straightforward fix, which I suspect it would be, then I would definitely be advocating for a fix. If it wasn't, I'd be advocating for waiting on whether customers complain. What would help would be any analytics that shows how many times users change/set the station per booking.

Finally when advocating to fix the issue I would use the story approach and emotive experience for the user. I've been there where I'm trying to arrange travel plans on the phone and the train app is being a bit of a pain. This is definitely the sort of behaviour that would leave a stressed out user wanting to replace this stupid f------ app.
(and yes I would use the f-bomb when verbally communicating as I've been around stressed Scottish travellers having difficulty with a train app and can 100% confirm that they would use this language!)
