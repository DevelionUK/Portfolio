## Module 11 Lesson 8: The confidence testing gives others

### Activity: How you build confidence through testing

Being transparent and open is important. As awesome as I am, I know that I won't test everything possible, think of and test every possible scenario, catching every single bug. If I did try that, we would never achieve our deadlines. A good example is that in my previous role we had features that interacted with third party devices with thousands of different devices by different manufacturers on different firmware. Testing with all of these isn't realistic so I would be having conversations about "what is enough to de-risk this feature?".

I aim to build trust by sharing my testing, highlighting the issues that I've found and being able to demonstrate what I've done through my notes. Similarly when a bug does escape my testing, I want to learn from it and won't pretend that I'm not perfect.

Finally I try to learn how the system works, what log messages mean and tap into the code base. This allows me to pair with developers or provide more technical information. If I'm able to articulate what I've done to investigate the issue (and not done) then the team know that when I'm raising a bug, I will have done my best to validate it is legit and provide as much relevant information as possible.
