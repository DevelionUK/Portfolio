## Module 11 Lesson 2: The types of observations we make whilst testing

### Activity: Practise categorising observations

I'm skipping the first two steps of the activity here as I've used PQIP many times in the past through my note taking tools. In fact, whilst I didn't explicitly call it out in a [blog post on exploratory testing](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2022/11/14/exploring-my-testing/), I built QPIP into my Detective Vision app. I've also used Xray Exploratory App and Yattie which incorporated QPIP.

I've definitely found it useful having the categories there when reviewing my findings with the team. It is nice to call out positives and also differentiate notes that are purely informational about my testing session or what I learnt as opposed to something other people in the team or the PO needs to know.

What I did realise when listening to Brittney and Callum talk was that my existing note taking tools don't provide filtering or re-organising. Consequently the first issue that I find is the first that someone will read. If there's a problem found later into a session, I'd need to filter for it. However it would be nice if I had the ability to filter and re-order items to better pick our issues and some colour coding could be useful (although accessibility is a consideration here).
