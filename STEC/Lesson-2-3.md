## Module 2 Lesson 3: Mind the gap! Use thought techniques to identify assumptions and overcome biases

### Reflection

This isn't the first time that I've had this thought but it was interesting reading the description of thought techniques:

> "Why was that my initial thought?"

In the past I undertook Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, aka CBT (I've also done my motorbike CBT!). I had a bunch of forms that were about challenging your thinking and they could be a really interesting thing to explore further when it comes to testing. Why do I have low confidence in software? Why am I concerned about stability?

I later wrote a [blog post](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/11/28/challenging-our-thinking-with-cbt/) on this topic.

### Activity: Use the 5Ws and H Framework to Challenge Assumptions

This activity was to complete a 5Ws & 1H exercise. Interestingly I've attended [a masterclass on it by Dan Ashby](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/talks/continuous-testing-throughout-the-sdlc-dan-ashby) and later ran this with one of my teams, which was well received and we ended up with lots and lots of questions (way more than expected - or that we could answer!).

I need to think of an interesting task where I've made a decision quickly, and things didn't go as expected. In particular a poor outcome.
