## Module 5 Lesson 2: The relationship between testing and quality

### Activity (Reflection) 
 
I've written about ["What is quality?"](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/03/what-is-quality/) in a bit of depth before but in short, it is a the value, excellence and correctness in our software. What matters most to us within that will vary depending on the context.

The characteristics and areas that we need to focus on and worry about will vary depending on the software that we are working on. For example when working with video security where your customers are casinos, airports and schools, the most important characteristics of a solution is it's reliability. This matters way more than usability. However if I'm playing a video game, I can live with the odd bug or even crash if I know that I enjoy it.

It is important that we understand the different needs of our users and the business. Previously I did a round of interviewing folk in different roles in the business and I'd ask them what quality meant to them and what they thought was most important for our users. Different people had different ideas and what was interesting was that it wasn't necessarily that the PO was right and devs were wrong but that the different insights impacted people. As a quality specialist I think it is important not just to consider what I think matters most for the user but to get a breadth of ideas.

Combining the thoughts of different people withe the patterns of escalations, user personas etc, I was able to group quality attributes into what matters most, what matters and what matters least. I was then using this with our patterns of defects to paint a picture of where data accuracy was a top priority but had issues with it. There was a caveat that this of course is slightly biased data because we likely tested with a greater focus on data quality than say accessibility, which ranked quite low.
