## Module 11 Lesson 9: When do you stop testing?

### Activity: When do you stop testing?

Typically I have a solid plan of what I want to test. If I uncover new risks or just get a "smell" then I may have additional charters but generally when I'm done with what I planned and if I've not identified anything new during my testing, I am done.

I will also stop early if there's critical enough defects that it isn't worth continuing (assuming I have other work to move on to) or having tested some of my scenarios, it is clear how the system is handling the behaviour therefore it isn't worthwhile repeating this. An example of this was a dialog where I was testing creating and updating items. Once it was clear that the dialog was the same one, just pre-populated, repeating some extensive validation testing on the same dialog isn't worthwhile. That said, I would call out when I've not tested something with the developer to be sure that I'm not missing a distinct path!
