## Module 10 Lesson 1: Fail to prepare, prepare to fail

### Activity: Prepare to test with purpose!

This was interesting as the lesson made some interesting points but I would never spend time considering all of these. Context and experience is important.

As the exercise suggested a game as possible choice, I'm going with Animal Crossing.

##### Documentation Review

Interestingly sometimes I liked delaying reviewing the requirements until an initial exploratory test to avoid biasing my expectations on how the user problem will be solved in the story. However it is imperative that we know what we're testing and to have studied the ACs. Some of the nuances in words can have a real impact. I likely would have done this, and identifying test data requirements, as part of test design (although the detail in my session plans was variable).

I would likely also need to review wikis or similar on how exactly I test a Nintendo Switch game, assuming this is my first time.

##### Access and Tools

For a Nintendo Switch game I would imagine that I'll need a unique toolset for deploying, debugging and gathering test data. Do I need to run the Nintendo in a special way in order to access a debug mode to spawn items, invoke events or monitor the system? There's probably a special channel required for comms, or maybe I'm on a simulator? This may have a bunch of different dependencies so are they all installed?

##### Test Data Preparation

An interesting thing to consider for a Nintendo game. I assume that I'll have some way of generating different environments. If I was involved in how that test data was created, I would make them visually unique to make it clear what island I've been spawned on.

##### Environment Verification

I know the landing page of the game displays the version so that is easy to test. However what am I running on? Are there hardware variances and is that easy to identify to report?

#### Staying on Track

##### Before Starting

- Tooling setup
- Simulator running / HW ready
- Build deployed
- Test island deployed
- Tests defined

##### During Testing

I don't need a checklist here.

##### After Testing

I don't need a checklist here.

#### Summary

This felt strange to complete when I've been testing since 17 years ago! However the point of the lesson was that having some structure and routine is valuable, as is ensuring we've done our due diligence before testing. Simply these techniques aren't for me.
