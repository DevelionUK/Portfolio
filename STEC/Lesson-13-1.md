## Module 13 Lesson 1: The problems with bugs

### Activity: From history to headlines: Understanding the impact of bugs

The [CroudStrike bug](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn056371561t) was a really interesting one as the impact was so far reaching. It impacted almost everyone in different ways as we lost access to essential services. What sticks with me most is seeing an image for the Mercedes F1 team staring at blue screens with CrowdStrike emblazoned across their outfit.

What I think that [Jitesh Gosai articulated in his MoTaCon 2025 talk](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/testbash-sessions/how-quality-is-created-maintained-and-lost-in-complex-software-systems?s_id=19031846) really well was how it wasn't one simple factor. It involved a plethora of process failures and issues for the bug to become so widespread.

Rather than focusing on "oh it was this coding error", I prefer to have a more holistic look at the problem through [meaningful RCAs](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/resources/meaningful-rcas/).
