## Module 11 Lesson 1: What is the work we do?

### Activity 1: Reflect on glue work

I've found that when working as a tester within a development team and also when working as a Quality Coach that I have indeed done a lot of glue work. I could act as a liason between the team and product as I'd be providing feedback and discussing potential changes. As my work was dependant on others in the team, I would challenge estimates on when we thought work would be completed. For example if I was seeing patterns of "tomorrow" being a repeated answer for completion, I'd raise it and ask how confident we were. This then opened some interesting conversations. Similar for tasks being left open when a story was passed to me.

I also ended up as a temporary scrum master in order to facilitate us moving to scrum as I had experience acting as that glue and helping people work together.

### Activity 2: Look again, think differently

I'll be honest, there wasn't a significant amount new from re-watching this but it was nice to hear things again.

### Activity 3: Recognise how your skills add value

- Inquisitiveness helps testers explore the behaviours of the software so that they can discover the answers to questions we didn't know beforehands.
- Influence helps testers promote quality so that they can work with leaedrship on improving our software.
- Attention to detail helps testers spot unexpected behaviours and minor mistakes so that they can report defects.
- Critical thinking helps testers process requirements and identify risks so that they can focus their testing.
- Listening and people skills helps testers understand and communicate with other colleagues so that they can collaborate effectively.
- Time management and organisation skills helps testers use their time effectively so that they can complete the priority testing.
- Adaptability helps testers adjust to ongoing needs of the business so that they can be always relied upon.
- Problem solving helps testers break down and find solutions to complicated challenges so that they can find reproduction steps or work out how to test a complicated feature.
- Collaboration helps testers work with other team members so that they can learn from others as well as support others.
- Communication helps testers be clear and understood so that they can advocte for fixes, raise issues and collaborate effectively.
- Spotting patterns helps testers see when patterns aren't followed so that they can identify potential defects or it helps them understand what is going on under the hood so that they can come up with new test ideas.
- Analytical skills helps testers understand the requirements and behaviour of the system so that they can identify new and interesting test ideas.

### Activity 4: Reflect on collaboration

Collaboration is something that I've really pushed within the past few years:

- Took a collaborative approach to [testing user journeys](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/10/26/user-journeys-testing/).
- Created a process for [collaborative test strategy](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/19/collaborative-test-strategy/).
- Ran collaborative [root cause analysis](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/11/meaningful-rcas-involving-the-right-people/) sessions.
- Led other various [collaborative reflections](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2023/10/22/collaborative-reflections/).
- Worked with people to deliver intiatives.

Trying to achieve things by yourself is not only more likely to fail but you gain more from multiple people's involvement. We can learn from each other with our different experiences and ideas.
