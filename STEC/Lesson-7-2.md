## Module 7 Lesson 2: How to use questions to build system models

### Activity: Formulate questions to uncover how a system works

For this I am looking at picking a system then identifying some key questions to ask about how it workds. For this I have chosen Fahlo, which is an app that lets you order bracelets & plushes then also gives you tracking information for your animals.

My key questions would be:
1. Where does the tracking data come from?
2. How is the shop processing its purchases?
3. How is the data stored & used to match people to tracked animals?
4. What is the infrastructure for hosting the services?
5. Are there any other services that have access to Fahlo data / APIs?

Depending on the makeup of the teams, I might need to ask a variety of different people from developers to dev ops to product.
