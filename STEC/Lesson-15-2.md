## Module 15 Lesson 2: What does testing debt look like?

### Activity: Spot the symptoms of testing debt

Lack of training or care to train in testing has been a key form of testing debt in the workplace in my experience. It leaves the team failing to improve and modernise, struggling to cope with demands as complexity, velocity and feature depth continue to need to grow. This later improved when I became a Quality Coach and had a little bit more freedom to explore new ideas and invest time, albeit with little / no time permitted to then support the developers with it.

Another symptom that I've seen is when automated tests take days or even weeks to write. As the tooling and infrastructure hasn't been invested in, it became really difficult to add any new automated test and this directly impacted our velocity. It was costing us significant time & effort, which translates to money. Within the business we'd championed to have this as a distinct project but unfortunately no budget could be allocated.

Finally documentation and I'll focus on test strategies. These were often viewed as signed off & done rather than accepting it being an evolving thing. This meant that the documents themselves were very quickly out of date and irrelevant. This is why I looked to [introduce an iterative approach that was light on documentation](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/19/collaborative-test-strategy/) and focused on having those meaningful conversations and building a shared understanding of how we'll test.
