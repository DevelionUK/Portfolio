### Activity: Exploring testing types

> Select two testing types from the lesson that you think you’ll use early in your career.
This activity is a bit weird when my career started in 2008!

Exploratory testing has been my favourite type of testing and when I get my next role (in between jobs at time of writing), it will be a really powerful way to learn about the software. The creativity part is really enjoyable and from my experience it is the best way to uncover information and learn.

I'm hoping to get more experience of API testing as it is something that I've done and always enjoyed. Using Postman, Bruno or SOAP UI is fun! (aside from when you have complex authentication to deal with!). I've also had some limited experience of static analysis, largely focused on dependencies, so understanding code quality is something that I'd love more hands on with. That might be unlikely in a test focused role.

Finally on black, white and grey box testing... I like to think of myself as a salt and pepper tester (testing, not hair colour at time of writing). Even if you do have some knowledge of the system, using a black box approach to really think about users can be powerful. I had a [really fun experience with my old work doing user focused testing](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/10/26/user-journeys-testing/) and it can be quite powerful. When issues arise, the ability to flex to grey/white box testing is then really useful. On top of that, the more I understand the system and the more that I can get beneath the surface, the more that I can find. As with Cassandra's example, not just using the UI but engaging with the API can uncover different information and defects.
