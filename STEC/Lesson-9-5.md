## Module 9 Lesson 5: Adaptable test design

### Activity: Define adaptable test design

Adaptable test design recognises that what we need to test may change as the product develops, we uncover risks and learn more about it.

By leveraging exploratory testing approaches we can learn, uncover information and test what is needed to validate and de-risk what has been implemented in this iteration/sprint. This can help inform what we test next, rather than sticking to a rigid plan determined in the past when we potentially had less knowledge and different priorities.
