## Module 11 Lesson 6: Bugs: problems and challenges

### Activity: Track a bug’s journey

I've found many bugs in my lifetime and also handled defects found by customers and raised as escalations.

One interesting bug was raised when testing trees in a mob testing session. I later entered the bug and then met with our PO to discuss the priority. We adopted a policy of fixing bugs ASAP, inspired by a zero bug policy (but not actually one). Subsequently it was investigated briefly by one of the development team so that we could understand the complexity and effort for the fix. This was fed back to the PO so that we could make a decision on pulling it into the next sprint.

Once fixed & verified we held an RCA on the issue. We talked about what automated tests are in place to prevent it from reoccuring and then also delved into how we can prevent making a similar mistake in the past.
