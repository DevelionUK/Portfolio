## Module 10 Lesson 5: Note taking: why does it matter?

### Activity: Experiment with different note taking techniques

I decided against following the entirety of this exercise as I've been note taking for a while.

I've found that your note taking approach might vary depending on the context of what you are testing. If I want lots of screenshots or videos then using a tool like Xray Exploratory App or Yattie can be useful. If videos won't factor, a Google doc or my own Detective Vision tool can be handy. I've also just had comments in Jira that I've been able to update. This would be when I have a Test Task within a story. The task and notes are for myself. I've also used Notepad and Notepad++, in particular when I expect my notes to be largely throwaway.

I've struggled with mindmaps in the past but have worked well with tools like Mural/Lucid. Sometimes having a fluid way of adding notes can be handy but with mindmaps I find it a pain to have the information visible and with verbosity that I want. For my notes I am also really keen on noting interesting values or timings, which I feel doesn't lend well to Mindmaps.

Sketchnoting is a technique that [I've explored a lot when creating my notes on talks](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/tag/sketchnotes/). In fact I learnt from a workshop by Marianne Duijst. However this is not something that I'd do for a story as it is more difficult to include in a user story.

Another tool that I use is pen and paper or post it notes. My notebooks are often filled with random little comments, values, dates and times or my desk may have a bunch of post it notes loitering around. However I usually throw them away afterwards!

I've not used the Cornell Method and my initial reaction was that I'd prefer more of a spreadsheet. It was interesting to find that this was known as the Chartering Method. However I'm more likely to use the Outline Method or if I'm using a tool like XEA, Yattie or Detective Vision then they are structured using PQIP.

Regardless of my approach, I always like providing my own summary afterwards to ensure that it doesn't take ages to read and they key information isn't lost. My notes would remain though, possibly linked from my summary.
