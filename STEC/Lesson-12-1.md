## Module 12 Lesson 1: Why do testers tell stories?

### Activity: Compare an issue reported by two testers

The first story isn't really a story, other than leading by saying what the person was testing. However the second story tells you about the impact on the user with an example of where it could impact a real user. Additionally it includes a picture and we know that pictures can tell a thousand words. Additionally this second story is better in its description as it uses words like "consistently" to let you know it isn't sporadic / one off.

I would argue that both could be improved as the story of the person's testing is less important and instead I would start the story by saying what I'm trying to achieve and then you can describe the process, hitting the bug and the impact.
