## Module 6 Lesson 3: Six powerful techniques for risk analysis

### Experience Notes

#### SWOT analysis

I've used SWOT in retrospectives and I think in a 1:1/PDP approach but not for risk analysis. It seems like an interesting way to pain a picture of how a team could cope with testing a project and the risks from their weaknesses.

#### Risk matrix

I've used this before with threat modelling amongst other things.

#### Scenario analysis

This was a new term to me. It is described as envisaging a scenario, agreeing what we think is the likely behaviour then testing for it. "What if" is a core question I'd pose when planning and also within refinement so it isn't entirely new and the scenarios like spikes in traffic are the sort of questions that I'd have looked at when considering system testing (kind of akin to OAT).

#### Risk Storming

I've done this both following the structure of the game and also a risk identification collaboration session. Running Risk Storming with my colleagues was interesting and it had us asking different questions to usual.

#### Nightmare headlines game

This is something that I've used with threat modelling and can totally see it being useful in more traditional risk identification / analysis. I think one of my Test Addict sessions had us thinking about Nightmare Headlines as well.

#### Root cause analysis (RCA)

I have a whole section dedicated to this on [my site](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/resources/meaningful-rcas/)! 

### Activity: Reflection

> Considering the six techniques you have just learned about, consider which one you think you would be most comfortable using and why.

I'm very comfortable with RCAs and would also be happy putting together a risk matrix. With RCAs, I've focused on it a lot over the past few years and refined and improved how I conduct them. However I wouldn't necessarily describe myself as doing risk analysis. That said, I did have the goal of combining our RCA results into data points that we could use AI to advise us on whether we're working in an area that has risks of problems then have the information on where they came from and how we can avoid making a similar mistake.
