## Module 7 Lesson 4: Creating models to support your testing

### Notes

- Range of reasons for using modelling
  - Representing testing notes & evidence
  - Testing & quality strategies
  - Risk investigation & analysis
- Discussed using modelling to understand the system (particularly context diagrams).
- Both Dan & Janet like the visual learning or act of drawing as it helps connect.
- Helps create more ideas
- Able to get people involved more than word salad
- Keeping it simple is important but don't oversimplify to misrepresent the complexity of the system
- Provides a structure to your thinking and representing it
- Using pen & paper for capturing ideas whenever you need (inc post it notes)
- Building up your repertoire of templates (but don't be constrained)

### Activity: Reflection

I absolutely love models for the reasons discussed by Dan & Janet. They have that visual power and can be a nice framework to help you think or provoke discussion.

I've used them to help understand the system behaviour and modelling would be a go to approach for starting in a new role. When talking through a new area of the system, even if there's a detailed architecture diagram I will use models to help us understand what is talking to what. Further to that I love them for representing the flow of the system, whether that is state models, swim lane diagrams or random doodling.

A great use case for models is when identifying risk. When doing test strategy I like to start with a model of the system and get us talking about risks. We then explore further using additional models, from mind maps to my own little templates. I've written about this [on my blog](https://www.r-adams.co.uk/2025/09/19/collaborative-test-strategy).
