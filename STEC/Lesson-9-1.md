## Module 9 Lesson 1: What is test design?

### Activity: What is your understanding of test design?

Test design is a creative and scientific process to determine what and how we'll test the software. It includes what information we'll be gathering and how impacts whether we're testing as intended.

I've found that it is something that gets conflated with test plans / test planning. Test planning doesn't include that "how" of test design, which can involve things like creating test cases, test data and writing charters. I suppose that it also depends on the level that you're designing. Are you designing your tests for a full product, a feature or just a story?

I often like to vary my test design from really simple, restricted to just the "what" to being quite detailed and this depends on what I feel is necessary to prepare and communicate in advance. As Cassandra says, testing informs further testing. I like to design my tests when there's more value and often this is in parallel with execution. That said, when I'm doing a performance test or something where my approach may impact the result, I'll take the time to design my tests.
