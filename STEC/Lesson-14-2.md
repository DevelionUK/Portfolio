## Module 14 Lesson 2: What to expect from modern test planning

### Activity: How has test planning changed?

More modern test planning tends to be more lightweight. It is specific to what exactly we're testing in the latest epic or even user story.

The time and effort that we spend planning has decreased so that we can focus on execution. I've found that there is less emphasis on the documentation and it is about the act of planning (the same with test strategy).

Importantly developers and testers are working closer together meaning that instead of having to "figure things out" ourselves or have separate detailed breakdowns of a feature to translate to a test plan then tests, we are able to collaborate and build it alongside developer activities.
