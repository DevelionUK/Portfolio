## Module 13 Lesson 4: Retesting and regression testing – What they are and why they matter

### Activity: Understanding retesting and regression testing

#### Scenario 1: Bug fix in e-commerce checkout

This would require retest of the defect and also regression test to ensure that the fix hasn't broken anything.

#### Scenario 2: New feature in banking app

Only regression testing (as well as acceptance & exploratory testing) would be applicable. Retesting isn't applicable.
