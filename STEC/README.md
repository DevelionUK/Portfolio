# Software Testing Essentials Certificate

Whilst completing the MoT Software Testing Essentials Certificate I intend to document my exercises publicly on GitHub.

## Lesson Activities

Note that not every lesson has an activity. Some lessons will prompt for reflection and in several occasions I will write this down as a personal reflection. After a particularly interesting lesson with no activity, I may reflect anyway.

As I'm an experienced tester, some of the "my first" activities may be skipped or replaced by my reflections on the skill.
