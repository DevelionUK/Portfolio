## Module 11 Lesson 3: Collaboration and communication

### Activity: Your top picks for collaboration and communication in testing

I've taken part in all of the collaboration and communication activities .

My favourite is definitely story shaping as this is an essential activity that I feel has been greatly improved by collaboration. Whether it is refinement or doing a 3As, having input from multiple people (especially test) helps ensure that edge cases are properly considered and that we are building the right thing.

For communication I haven't had a huge amount of benefit from dashboards but stand ups are an important way for teams to keep up to date. It helped me understand where work was and when it would be ready to pick up as well as being an opportunity to highlight lack of work of when I'm going to be overwhelmed. Testing notes and debriefs are also really important too. As a tester I value them and when applicable, they can be useful for the full team but not necessarily always.
