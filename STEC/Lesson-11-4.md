## Module 11 Lesson 4: Test artefacts: their purpose, creation, and challenges

### Activity: Your test artefact toolkit

For this activity I am in the scenario where I am joining a new team mid sprint and need to get up to speed quickly. I'm going to assume that no tests have been written for me in advance when completing this exercise (although of course I would ask what exists and has been done!).

First I would look for a test strategy or plan. Either is fine. This is to help me understand what testing looks like on this team and project and what will be expected of my testing approach.W

Next I would look for requirements / release notes and the documentation to understand what the product is and what has changed. A risk matrix would add to this. By looking at these and discussing with the team, it would help me come up with a plan or strategy to understand what is highest risk as well as get developer input on what they are worries about or confident with.

Finally I'd look at the automated test coverage. If we have strong automation coverage of behaviours or code areas then I can be confident in spending less time on that area, in particular with any regression checking.
