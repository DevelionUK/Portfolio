## Module 15 Lesson 1: What is technical debt?

### Activity: Define technical debt in your own words

Technical debt is what you grow by either consciously or unconsciously deciding not to continuously improve your code base or allowing bad practices to live within the code.

It can arise from making decisions or sacrifices to allow for quicker delivery ("we'll do that later") and also from negligence like failing to reevaluate your architecture or maintaining the code that you are working on. Gaps in unit tests that lead to others leaving gaps or failing to write testable code can snowball into an untestable and risky code base.

The impact of this can be that is slows down delivery long term. You risk builds taking longer and more likely, having a more challenging time to successfully make changes in an area down the line with a consequence of more defects arising.

Sometimes it is a necessary evil, so long as it is a conscious decision and it is clearly understood that we're accepting this technical debt.
